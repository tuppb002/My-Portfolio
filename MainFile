Hello! If you are reading this then I have probebly linked you here, giving you an overview of me and my devlopment.

**Skills**
From personal experience and growth, I have learned that I take a leaned back approach developing, and I do not take well to deadlines.
I have built my own railway company with absolutly zero deadlines, but only hopeful times.
Some examples of my work are as follows:

**Timescales:**
For timings, a decent sized, detailed station (can be compared to Ashford International) can take me anywhere from 1 to 3 weeks,
depending on circumstances and availiablity.
For small things it can take me a day or so.

I generally require no payment (unless otherwise stated) as sometimes the respect of being a developer for some places is enough.

Thanks, and I hope to work with you soon.
